abstract = {In the past ten years, the source of DDoS has migrated to botnets composed of IoT devices. The scale of DDoS attacks increases dramatically with the number of IoT devices.New variants of DDoS attacks using different system vulnerabilities emerge in an endless stream. In response to this situation, researchers have made significant contributions to the field of DDoS defense by applying modern programmable network technology and network-level resource scheduling management technology. However, the existing review articles need more research on these technologies. After investigating the development trend of DDoS attacks in recent years and the new challenges caused by them, this paper classifies the new technologies that have emerged in the field of DDoS defense in the past ten years. Among them, the collaboration between domains and inter-domain resource scheduling is one of the critical challenges in designing a large-scale distributed DDoS cooperative defense system. In addition, modern programmable network technology has dramatically expanded network systemsâ€™ functional diversity and deployment flexibility. We will discuss building a defense system based on programmable networks and focus on SOTA defense solutions based on programmable switches. Finally, developing DDoS defense mechanisms with broad-spectrum detection capabilities, robustness against adversarial attacks, and cost-effective and collaborative DDoS defense mechanisms for establishing the Internet are future research directions in network security.}
