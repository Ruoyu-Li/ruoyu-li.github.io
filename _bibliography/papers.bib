abstract = {In the past ten years, the source of DDoS has migrated to botnets composed of IoT devices. The scale of DDoS attacks increases dramatically with the number of IoT devices.New variants of DDoS attacks using different system vulnerabilities emerge in an endless stream. In response to this situation, researchers have made significant contributions to the field of DDoS defense by applying modern programmable network technology and network-level resource scheduling management technology. However, the existing review articles need more research on these technologies. After investigating the development trend of DDoS attacks in recent years and the new challenges caused by them, this paper classifies the new technologies that have emerged in the field of DDoS defense in the past ten years. Among them, the collaboration between domains and inter-domain resource scheduling is one of the critical challenges in designing a large-scale distributed DDoS cooperative defense system. In addition, modern programmable network technology has dramatically expanded network systems’ functional diversity and deployment flexibility. We will discuss building a defense system based on programmable networks and focus on SOTA defense solutions based on programmable switches. Finally, developing DDoS defense mechanisms with broad-spectrum detection capabilities, robustness against adversarial attacks, and cost-effective and collaborative DDoS defense mechanisms for establishing the Internet are future research directions in network security.}

In Dryad, we first develop a large and accurate “one-training-for-all“ DT (ODT) that can be quickly resized without computational retraining. ODTs are deployed in switches using a progressive search algorithm that searches the adaptations according to their resources. To achieve high accuracy and low packet latency, the adaptation leverages 1) innovative hard and soft pruning methods to compress the ODT rapidly with minimal performance loss; and 2) P4 scaling operations of match-action table arrangement and joint range-ternary match, which allow the switch to accommodate a larger (i.e., more accurate) ODT. Finally, an ODTCompiler is proposed to automatically convert the adapted ODT into a P4 program and then install it. Experimental results on three commodity switches under different resource scenarios show that Dryad achieves a higher classification F1-score (3.78 % higher), and completes the adaptation 161 × faster than other solutions. },

abstract = {Smart homes, powered by the Internet of Things, offer great convenience but also pose security concerns due to abnormal behaviors, such as improper operations of users and potential attacks from malicious attackers. Several behavior modeling methods have been proposed to identify abnormal behaviors and mitigate potential risks. However, their performance often falls short because they do not effectively learn less frequent behaviors, consider temporal context, or account for the impact of noise in human behaviors. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an autoencoder-based unsupervised user behavior anomaly detection framework. First, we design a Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy (LDMS) to encourage the model to learn less frequent behaviors, which are often overlooked during learning. Second, we propose a Three-level Time-aware Position Embedding (TTPE) to incorporate temporal information into positional embedding to detect temporal context anomaly. Third, we propose a Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss (NWRL) that assigns different weights for routine behaviors and noise behaviors to mitigate the interference of noise behaviors during inference. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SmartGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and also offers highly interpretable results.},

abstract = {With the deployment of a growing number of smart home IoT devices, privacy leakage has become a growing concern. Prior work on privacy-invasive device localization, classification, and activity identification have proven the existence of various privacy leakage risks in smart home environments. However, they only demonstrate limited threats in real world due to many impractical assumptions, such as having privileged access to the user's home network. In this paper, we identify a new end-to-end attack surface using IoTBeholder, a system that performs device localization, classification, and user activity identification. IoTBeholder can be easily run and replicated on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices such as mobile phones or personal computers, enabling attackers to infer user's habitual behaviors from smart home Wi-Fi traffic alone. We set up a testbed with 23 IoT devices for evaluation in the real world. The result shows that IoTBeholder has good device classification and device activity identification performance. In addition, IoTBeholder can infer the users' habitual behaviors and automation rules with high accuracy and interpretability. It can even accurately predict the users' future actions, highlighting a significant threat to user privacy that IoT vendors and users should highly concern.},

abstract = {With the booming of smart home market, intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been increasingly involved in home life. To improve the user experience of smart homes, some prior works have explored how to use machine learning for predicting interactions between users and devices. However, the existing solutions have inferior User Device Interaction (UDI) prediction accuracy, as they ignore three key factors: routine, intent and multi-level periodicity of human behaviors. In this paper, we present SmartUDI, a novel accurate UDI prediction approach for smart homes. First, we propose a Message-Passing-based Routine Extraction (MPRE) algorithm to mine routine behaviors, then the contrastive loss is applied to narrow representations among behaviors from the same routines and alienate representations among behaviors from different routines. Second, we propose an Intent-aware Capsule Graph Attention Network (ICGAT) to encode multiple intents of users while considering complex transitions between different behaviors. Third, we design a Cluster-based Historical Attention Mechanism (CHAM) to capture the multi-level periodicity by aggregating the current sequence and the semantically nearest historical sequence representations through the attention mechanism. SmartUDI can be seamlessly deployed on cloud infrastructures of IoT device vendors and edge nodes, enabling the delivery of personalized device service recommendations to users. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that SmartUDI consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines with more accurate and highly interpretable results.},
