abstract = {In the past ten years, the source of DDoS has migrated to botnets composed of IoT devices. The scale of DDoS attacks increases dramatically with the number of IoT devices.New variants of DDoS attacks using different system vulnerabilities emerge in an endless stream. In response to this situation, researchers have made significant contributions to the field of DDoS defense by applying modern programmable network technology and network-level resource scheduling management technology. However, the existing review articles need more research on these technologies. After investigating the development trend of DDoS attacks in recent years and the new challenges caused by them, this paper classifies the new technologies that have emerged in the field of DDoS defense in the past ten years. Among them, the collaboration between domains and inter-domain resource scheduling is one of the critical challenges in designing a large-scale distributed DDoS cooperative defense system. In addition, modern programmable network technology has dramatically expanded network systems’ functional diversity and deployment flexibility. We will discuss building a defense system based on programmable networks and focus on SOTA defense solutions based on programmable switches. Finally, developing DDoS defense mechanisms with broad-spectrum detection capabilities, robustness against adversarial attacks, and cost-effective and collaborative DDoS defense mechanisms for establishing the Internet are future research directions in network security.}

abstract = {Smart homes, powered by the Internet of Things, offer great convenience but also pose security concerns due to abnormal behaviors, such as improper operations of users and potential attacks from malicious attackers. Several behavior modeling methods have been proposed to identify abnormal behaviors and mitigate potential risks. However, their performance often falls short because they do not effectively learn less frequent behaviors, consider temporal context, or account for the impact of noise in human behaviors. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an autoencoder-based unsupervised user behavior anomaly detection framework. First, we design a Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy (LDMS) to encourage the model to learn less frequent behaviors, which are often overlooked during learning. Second, we propose a Three-level Time-aware Position Embedding (TTPE) to incorporate temporal information into positional embedding to detect temporal context anomaly. Third, we propose a Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss (NWRL) that assigns different weights for routine behaviors and noise behaviors to mitigate the interference of noise behaviors during inference. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SmartGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and also offers highly interpretable results.},
