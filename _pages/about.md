## About me

This is the homepage of Ruoyu Li (Roy, 李若愚). I am an Assistant Professor with the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn) (see my official website [here](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=1327)), collaborating with Professor [Laizhong Cui](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/cuilz/eng/index.html). In 2024, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), where I was part of [Smart Internet Group (SIG)](https://smartinternet.group/) and was advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Doctor [Qing Li](https://smartinternet.group/qing/). During that time, I also served as a research intern at [Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn). In 2019, I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science (Security Track) from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), where I was advised by Professor [Henning Schulzrinne](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/henning-schulzrinne) (IEEE & ACM Fellow) and Doctor [Gaston Ormazabal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaston-ormazabal-8304893/). In 2017, I received my B.Eng. degree in Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I was advised by Professor [Peng Xu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/xupeng1/zh_CN/index.htm).


## Research Interests

My primary research areas include **data-driven network security**, **IoT security**, **programmable networking**, and **trustworthy AI**. I have been engaged in long-term research in fields such as encrypted traffic analysis, botnet and DDoS detection and prevention, IoT anomaly detection, AI-enabled network monitoring, explainable machine learning, and programmable data plane. Recently, I am exploring the development of foundation models for network security by LLMs. My long-term goal is to build cyberspace security frameworks with better intelligence, efficiency, robustness, and usability that effectively reduce the labor intensity of cybersecurity industry.
