## Hobbies

(I bet you won't read this far)

üèÄ Basketball Fan: I‚Äôve been a die-hard Kobe fan for nearly 20 years (Mamba forever!), and now I mostly spend my time amazed by Nikola Jokic. My GOAT is Michael Jordan‚Äîno debate allowed. Seriously.

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gym Lover: When I‚Äôm not on court, I'll go to gym, mainly to keep my jumpshot alive. My squat and deadlift reached 1.7 times my bodyweight (120kg)‚Äîbasically strong enough to carry my team.

üéß Rap Music Addict: I‚Äôve also been obsessed with rap music for over 15 years. My playlist includes almost every style you can imagine‚ÄîChinese, English, Boombap, Jazz, Trap, Drill, Memphis, Afrobeats, Jersey Club‚Ä¶ you name it. I'm always dreaming to become a beat maker and making those head-nodding tracks myself.
