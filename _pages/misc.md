## Hobbies

Basketball Fan: I’ve been a die-hard Kobe fan for nearly 20 years (Mamba forever!), and now I mostly spend my time amazed by Jokic and Doncic. My GOAT is Michael Jordan—no debate allowed. Seriously.

Gym Lover: When I’m not on court, I'll go to gym, mainly to keep my jumpshot alive. My squat and deadlift reached 1.7 times my bodyweight (120kg)—basically strong enough to carry my team.

Rap Music Addict: I’ve also been obsessed with rap music for over 15 years. My playlist includes almost every style you can imagine—Chinese, English, Boombap, Jazz, Trap, Drill, Memphis, Afrobeats, Jersey Club… you name it. I'm always thinking to become a beat maker and making those head-nodding tracks myself.
